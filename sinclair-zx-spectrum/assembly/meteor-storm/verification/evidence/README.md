# Native checkpoint evidence

- `checkpoints.json`: seventeen complete builds, upstream Pasmo byte parity and
  142 execution checks. Every source/data hash matches the maintained files.
- `boundaries.json`: four keyboard-only contact/near-miss cases.
- `endpoint.json`: 49 native checks, including exact reference measurements and
  a separate fresh ROM tape load. It retains the accepted prototype source hash.
- `title.png`, `flight.png`, `hit.png`, `miss.png`: inspected native captures.

Run the three Python scripts in the parent directory to reproduce these reports,
passing an emulator executable and a temporary output directory. Captures and
build products go there; source files are not rewritten. `checkpoints.py` accepts
an optional upstream Pasmo executable for binary comparison. The endpoint uses
the independent accepted route from `prototype/verification/model-results.json`.

The game reference source is unchanged; teaching-source cleanup is explicit in
the module README. Whole-tape hashes include the assembler's output-path-derived
code-header name; raw code parity is tested separately.

Some batched native result PNGs were incomplete even though bitmap-memory checks
found the full score line. They have not been selected as lesson illustrations.
Result-screen visual review belongs in browser/interactive verification before
publication. Audio captures exist in the temporary endpoint output; this record
does not claim listening review or physical-hardware testing.
