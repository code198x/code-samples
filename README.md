# Retro Development Projects

Welcome to my all-in-one repository for retro system development. This repo contains code, tools, and workflows for a range of vintage systems including the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amiga, and more.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Write clean, understandable code targeting classic systems
- Build modern toolchains using cross-compilers and emulators
- Blog and document the journey as part of a long-term retro coding series
- Use GitHub Actions to automate builds for each system

## ðŸ—‚ Structure

Each system has its own directory:

```
retro-dev/
â”œâ”€â”€ zx-spectrum/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/         # Z80 assembly source code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ build/       # Compiled TAP and BIN files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile     # Build instructions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ .github/workflows/  # GHA workflow for ZX Spectrum
â”œâ”€â”€ c64/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ amiga/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## ðŸ”§ GitHub Actions

Each system includes its own GitHub Actions workflow that:

- Watches for changes to its source and Makefile
- Installs required tools (e.g., `pasmo`, `z80asm`)
- Runs builds and uploads `.tap`, `.bin`, or equivalent artifacts

## ðŸ“š Blog Series

This repo accompanies my blog series on retro game and software development. You can follow along starting with the [introductory post](#) and watch as we bring these classic systems back to life â€” one byte at a time.

Stay tuned!
