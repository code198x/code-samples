# Correct Game Development Plan - Code198x Phase 1

## Overview

This document defines the precise development process for implementing the correct games according to specifications, avoiding the template replication issues that occurred previously.

## Development Principles

### 1. Specification-First Development
- Every game must be designed from its specification first
- No code begins until the game mechanics are fully defined
- Each system gets a unique game type that showcases its strengths

### 2. System-Specific Optimization
- Each game should leverage the unique capabilities of its target system
- Graphics and mechanics must be authentic to the platform
- No cross-system template replication

### 3. Verification Gates
- Each development phase has specific verification criteria
- Games must pass genre-specific tests (breakout vs platformer vs racing)
- Implementation must match specification before moving to next lesson

## Development Guidelines

### Before Starting Each Game
1. **Read the specification** from CLAUDE.md
2. **Understand the game genre** completely
3. **Research similar games** on the target system
4. **Plan system-specific features** to highlight
5. **Create mockups** or sketches of gameplay

### During Development
1. **Implement genre-specific mechanics first**
2. **Test core gameplay** before adding features
3. **Use system-appropriate graphics techniques**
4. **Avoid copying mechanics from other systems**
5. **Focus on authentic platform experience**

### After Each Lesson
1. **Verify against specification**
2. **Test on emulator/hardware**
3. **Document any deviations** from plan
4. **Update verification scripts**
5. **Plan next lesson features**

## Prevention Measures

### Template Prevention
- **No shared code** between systems

- **Regular specification review** during development
- **Peer review** of game mechanics

### Quality Assurance
- **Specification compliance check** before each lesson
- **Genre verification** (breakout vs platformer vs racing)
- **System authenticity review** (does it feel like a native game?)
- **Educational value assessment** (does it teach the right concepts?)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Emulator compatibility**: Test on multiple emulators
- **Hardware limitations**: Stay within system capabilities
- **Performance issues**: Profile and optimize regularly
- **Graphics complexity**: Use appropriate techniques for each system

### Educational Risks
- **Specification drift**: Regular review against original specs
- **Feature creep**: Stick to lesson-appropriate complexity
- **System confusion**: Ensure each system feels unique
- **Learning curve**: Maintain appropriate difficulty progression

## Success Metrics

### Development Success
- All games match their specifications exactly
- Each system demonstrates unique capabilities
- Code compiles and runs on target hardware/emulators
- Games feel authentic to their respective platforms

### Educational Success
- Games teach appropriate concepts for each system
- Progressive complexity across lessons
- Clear demonstration of system-specific features
- Engaging gameplay that motivates learning

## Next Steps

1. **Create detailed game design documents** for each system
2. **Set up development environment** for each platform
3. **Begin implementation** starting with Lesson 1 for all systems
4. **Establish regular review schedule** to prevent specification drift
5. **Document all decisions** and lessons learned

This plan should prevent the template replication issues and ensure each system gets the correct, authentic game implementation it deserves.
